# Iteration Summary Report

## 1. Project Goal
The primary goal of this iteration was to build the foundational, mobile-first version of a cross-platform inventory management application using Flutter. The focus was on implementing the core features and establishing a clean, scalable architecture.

## 2. Completed Features
The following major features were fully implemented and are functional in the application:

-   **Product & Material Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) screens and logic for managing products and materials.
-   **Local Database:** A robust local database was set up using the `drift` package to persist all application data on the device.
-   **Product-Material Mapping:** A dedicated UI was created to allow users to map materials to products with specific quantities. This screen supports adding, editing, and deleting these mappings.
-   **Production Logging:** A feature was added to log production events (e.g., "10 units of Product X were built"). This was a necessary addition to support time-based reporting.
-   **Reporting System:** Two key reports were developed:
    -   **Material Usage by Product:** Calculates total material consumption for a selected product within a given date range.
    -   **Overall Material Usage:** Calculates the total usage for every material across all produced products in a date range.
    -   Both reports include quick filters for "Today", "This Week", and "This Month".
-   **Export & Share:** Both reports can be exported.
    -   **PDF:** Exported PDFs can be shared using the native system share sheet, which allows for saving, printing, or sending via email.
    -   **CSV:** Exported CSV data is displayed in a dialog for easy copying.
-   **UI/UX Polish:**
    -   Search functionality was added to the product and material list screens.
    -   Confirmation dialogs were added for all delete operations to prevent accidental data loss.

## 3. Key Decisions & Workarounds

-   **Added Production Log:** It was determined that the initial schema could not support time-based reporting. After consulting with the user, a `ProductionLog` table and a corresponding UI feature were added to the project to enable accurate reporting.
-   **Manual Code Generation:** The development environment exhibited a persistent failure of the `build_runner` command. This prevented the automatic generation of code for `drift` and `mockito`. To overcome this, all necessary `.g.dart` files were manually written and updated throughout the development process.
-   **Skipped Automated Tests:** Due to the `build_runner` failure, it was not possible to generate mock objects needed for unit testing. As per user instruction, this step was skipped to proceed with development.

## 4. Known Omissions from this Iteration
The following items from the original, broad project request were not addressed in this iteration and are considered out of scope for this phase:

-   **Web Backend:** No implementation of a REST API or a remote database (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL) for the web version of the application was performed. The current app is mobile-only.
-   **Direct Email Sending:** The "Send to Email" feature was implemented via the PDF share sheet. A dedicated, direct email sending feature using SMTP was not built.
